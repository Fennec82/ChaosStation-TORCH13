changes:
  - refactor: "Changes how xenoarch generation works to make it take up less memory. Leaves an EXTREME amount of comments to help future maintainers dig through the mess that is xenoarch code."
  - qol: "Makes the Artifact Analyzer give you actually accurate data that isn't completely cluttered. Tells you what the artifact does (vaguely), its activation requirements, and what range it does it in."
  - bugfix: "Fixes the Artifact Harvester so it actually works for ALL artifacts and can harvest object artifacts properly."
  - bugfix: "Fixes the Artifact Harvester and makes it able to harvest artifacts that have more than 1 effect"
  - code_imp: "Added a debug proc to the game to allow spawning minor artifacts for easy testing & admin events."
  - code_imp: " Changes /obj/item/New() to /obj/item/Initialize(mapload)"
  - rscdel: "Removes 'anomaly depth' and 'anomaly dispersion', meaning the depth of the artifact is how deep you need to dig. No longer has a range."
  - qol: "Removes the Suspension Generator requirement for artifacts. Can now be excavated without it."
  - qol: "Makes the excavation drill faster and able to go down to 60 depth"
  - qol: "Gives the xenoarcheology closet the excavation drill at spawn."
  - qol: "Expands the list of reagents that can be used to activate chemical requirements for artifacts."
  - qol: "Rocky Debris no longer spawns randomly."
  - qol: "Rocky Debris only spawns when an artifact is held within the rock."
  - qol: "LARGE artifacts can no longer be accidentally destroyed. This means miners will no longer eat rads to the face and upset science at the same time."
  - qol: "Strange Rocks no longer require a brush/welder to be used. Any pick will work."
  - qol: "Makes plant artifacts give a description to say that they should be given to xenoflora"
  - qol: "Massively lowers the rate of fossils and bones spawning."
  - qol: "Removes a lot of random RNG that made no sense, like touching having a 75% chance to not activate a touch artifact."
  - qol: "Makes it so you can touch artifacts with gloves to activate them, but not bump them if you have gloves."
  - refactor: "Condenses all the gas artifacts into one artifact type & file."
  - refactor: "Condenses good/bad/cannible feel, hot/cold atmos, heal/harm, and synth heal/harm into singular types instead of duplicated files."
  - code_imp: "Changes all istype to ishuman, isrobot, ismob where appropriate in the xenoarch code."
  - code_imp: "Changes Bold to span_bold() where appropriate in the xenoarch code."
  - rscadd: "Adds a wrench to the xenoarch supply pack"
  - rscadd: "Adds the xenoarcheology depth scanner to mining vendor. (Allows miners to excavate, but not locate artifacts to prevent jobstealing.)"
  - bugfix: "Makes the xenoarch syringe find no longer go invisible"
  - bugfix: "Fixes a bug where sometimes, nothing would spawn when an artifact was excavated."
  - bugfix: "Fixes a bug where sometimes a large artifact would have the 'datum/artifact_effect/extreme' effect which did nothing."
  - bugfix: "Fixes a server crashing bug where - very rarely - a gravity anomaly would be triggered by touch, resulting in an infinite loop. Added comments to tell you not to touch it."
  - rscadd: "Sets of artifacts can now spawn. Primarily used for xeno organs and cult armor."
  - rscadd: "Makes it so Human Remains finds will spawn with a random organ"
  - rscadd: "Makes it so Alien Remains finds will spawn with a xenomorph plasma vessel + xenomorph organ"
  - rscadd: "Makes it so Robot Remains finds will spawn a robot drone pod (Allowing for ghosts to take control of it and become a vore robot)"
  - rscadd: "Makes it so Gun Finds (energy and projectile) will spawn with randomized projectiles."
  - rscadd: "Makes it so xenoarch syringe find will spawn with random reagents"
  - rscadd: "Makes it so xenoarch bowls/urns will generate random reagents"
  - rscadd: "Swaps the Cult Blade spawn with an Artifact Blade that has a collection of unique upsides and downsides. Just don't try to hit your fellow crew with it!"
  - rscadd: "Makes the anomaly scanner do a 'wavelength change' if the Z level runs out of small/large artifacts. This creates more digsites around the user."
  - rscadd: "Adds a new 'power generator' artifact. Commented out until some good sounds can be procured."
  - rscdel: "Deletes a lot of useless junk from the spawnpool, like cutlery, rods, and shards."
  - rscadd: "Makes 'material stack' drops found via xenoarch select a random material from the game (with a blacklist) instead of a few select ones."
  - rscadd: "Expanded the alien tool drops and also allows them to spawn with an alien equipment piece as well."
  - rscadd: "Allows tomes to be unearthed in xenoarch. (No functionality, just fluff)"
  - rscadd: "Makes any objects that have subtypes have a chance of having the subtype spawn in."
  - balance: "Makes it so the gasmask actually spawns a unique one (poltergeist or voice) instead of just a normal, mundane gasmask."
  - bugfix: "Makes it so the 'cult armor' artifact actually spawns armor"
  - bugfix: "Makes the shock maul play a different sound when powered down and used on a rock."
  - bugfix: "Makes Shadow wrights not sit in nullspace forever after activating"
  - rscadd: "Makes shadow wrights give you some text when they KO you instead of just disappearing"
  - balance: "Adjusted xenoarch large artifact spawnrates."
  - balance: "More xenoarch large artifacts spawn in the universe now."
  - balance: "Makes the vampiric artifact and vampiric statue give you rewards for feeding them instead of giving you pain and suffering through spawning mobs on top of you."
