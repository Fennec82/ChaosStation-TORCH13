changes:
  - rscadd: "Added railings to many areas in maintenance which were missing them causing easy fall risk, especially around ladders. Maints is now 90% more Space OSHA approved!"
  - rscadd: "Added lattices above the dock areas where maints trash exists. Hopefully this should keep the mice and raccoons safe."
  - rscadd: "Gave the AI a light switch so they don't have to live in a dark basement"
  - rscdel: "Deleted the signs on deck 3 for a transit tube that did not exist, and filled in the missing emergency shutter"
  - rscdel: "Deleted the APC in the abandoned chapel. Area doesn't need power anyway and if someone wants to power it they can build their own APC. It wasn't wired up anyway."
  - rscdel: "Removed the AI entertainment monitors. AI doesn't like TV anyway and they were blocking intercoms"
  - rscdel: "Removed the nitrous anaesthetic from Robotics"
  - qol: "The command office request consoles are now allowed to make station announcements"
  - qol: "Gave the kitchen their booze back"
  - qol: "Gives engineering a light replacer tool"
  - qol: "Added plating under the catwalks on the tesla platform so borgs can go for a space walk"
  - bugfix: "Fixed a couple of bypass breakers with wires underneath still, bypassing the bypass."
  - bugfix: "Fixed a disposals bin above the botanical kitchen that wasn't connected to the network"
  - bugfix: "Added a missing connector for the airlock tanks on the secondary engine airlock"
  - bugfix: "Replaced airless plating in toxins lab with some breathable air."
  - bugfix: "Fixed the air alarm naming conventions"
  - bugfix: "Hopefully fixed persistent storages (though can't test this). Locations of storages are up for debate but given the location of the qpad, I think cargo could benefit from a transit tube in future updates"
  - bugfix: "Fixed the terrain below medical that was having shields generated on it (lost the Sif look for now)\nfix; Fixed the AI chamber wiring being back to front and causing the AI to die at round start"
  - bugfix: "Fixed some powernet sensors that weren't connected to the subgrids properly and added a distinction for outpost R-UST Input and Output grids. Deleted a doubled up engineering sensor."
  - maptweak: "Remapped the supermatter cold loop to be a bit more beginner-friendly for modifications as well as making it flow better normally. Feel free to play with the setup in-round though!"
  - maptweak: "Replaced two Nitrogen canisters with phoron canisters in the supermatter gas storage (4 nitrogen 4 phoron to 2 nitrogen 6 phoron). Nitrogen gets used a lot more rarely and surprisingly few phoron canisters about. This should be a better QoL change for SM engines."
  - maptweak: "Replaced engineering's advanced shield equipment with basic ones, so cargo still had one more reason to exist."
  - maptweak: "Recoloured the secondary engine output wires from pink to yellow to differentiate it from the primary engine. This will be particularly useful later with plans I have for shield gens at some point-. Also recoloured the coils left for setup to cyan and yellow to match the wires in use in that area."
  - maptweak: "Closed off a few drop vore spots that allowed too easy access to restricted areas with glass. You can still see and break in to eat people but no easy dropping in and printing whatever you want off the protolathe. Some less secure spots are left unprotected and have some lattices to allow escape, and I did the same with the public area spots as well."
  - maptweak: "Rewired the solar APCs to run off mains so they don't shut down the airlocks when solars aren't working. Added an extra coil to the Eastern SMES to allow them to cope with the additional load from the extra arrays."
  - maptweak: "Gave the bar pretty see-through shutters so it looks less industrial while closed"
  - maptweak: "Replaced the SM doors and blast doors with ones that shouldn't melt so easy this time. Also the doors should be obvious that they're bolted now."
  - maptweak: "Set the secondary engine power supply SMES output to off at round start so it doesn't drain all it's power before the second engine can be set up."
